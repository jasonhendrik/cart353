I am an emerging artist and interaction designer, especially interested in emphasizing how physical environments evolve through a continual process of re-imagination and collective creativity. My works, often combine traditional craft making techniques and interactive computational techniques, in an attempt to demonstrate a worthy fusion of art to technology.

The Exquisite Corpse  is an interactive mirror that captures an image of your body and breaks it apart into pieces. It then reflects to you a body built from many people's body parts. The idea is that we are never wholly our own person. The Exquisite Corpse mirror enables one to explore the very processes of self recognition, self awareness and the development of one’s identity.  Ideally, the experience will help  us to understand that we are all in many ways, affecting each other’s identity. Essentially, this work is a revisiting of the old Parlor Game we’ve hopefully all played at least once in our lives. Reflecting on the mixing of ideas to get to  completely different and new ones, Exquisite Corpse attempts to exemplify the promotion of inspiration through randomness.
